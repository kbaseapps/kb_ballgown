parameters :
  expressionset_ref :
    ui-name : |
      Expression Set
    short-hint : |
      Select the expression set associated with transcripts assembled by Cufflinks or StringTie
  diff_expression_matrix_set_name :
    ui-name : |
      Differential Expression Matrix Set
    short-hint : |
      Provide a name for the differential expression analysis output object
  input_type:
    ui-name : |
      Data Type
    short-hint : |
      Should CuffDiff be run on the gene or transcript level?
  run_all_combinations:
    ui-name : |
      Run All Paired Condition Combinations
    short-hint : |
      Run All Paired Condition Combinations
  condition:
        ui-name : |
            Condition Label
        short-hint : |
            A set of valid condition labels used in the specified expression set

parameter-groups :
    condition_pair_subset :
        ui-name : OR list a subset of at least two conditions on which to run paired combinations
        short-hint : Ballgown will run pairwise combinations of condition pairs from the conditions you list (If you choose this option, please uncheck 'Run All Paired Condition Combinations')

description : |
    <p>This App allows users to select the single-end or paired-end read files and provide the metadata for a set of samples to create an RNASeqSampleSet object. Note that the user must provide reads for two or more samples.</p>

    <p>Users need to import single-end or paired-end read files to their Narrative before starting this App.</p>

    <p>It is mandatory to select the "Library Type", "Domain", "RNA-seq Sample and Condition Labels" and provide the "RNA-seq Sample Set" (RNASeqSampleSet object name). All replicates for the same condition must have same label.</p>

    <p>Users can optionally fill in additional metadata information in the advanced options.</p>

    <p><b>Note: Ballgown requires at least one intron to function. Also, this app will not work on prokaryotes.</b></p>
