parameters :
  expressionset_ref :
    ui-name : |
      Expression Set
    short-hint : |
      Select the expression set associated with transcripts assembled by StringTie or Cufflinks.
  diff_expression_matrix_set_name :
    ui-name : |
      Differential Expression Matrix Set
    short-hint : |
      Provide a name for the differential expression analysis output object.
  input_type:
    ui-name : |
      Data Type
    short-hint : |
      Should CuffDiff be run on the gene or transcript level?
  run_all_combinations:
    ui-name : |
      Run All Paired Condition Combinations
    short-hint : |
      Run all paired condition combinations.
  condition:
        ui-name : |
            Condition Label
        short-hint : |
            A set of valid condition labels used in the specified expression set.

parameter-groups :
    condition_pair_subset :
        ui-name : OR list a subset of at least two conditions on which to run paired combinations
        short-hint : Ballgown will run pairwise combinations of condition pairs from the conditions you list. If you choose this option, please uncheck 'Run All Paired Condition Combinations.'

description : |
    <p>This App provides differential expression matrix in two or more RNA-seq experiments, using the output of StringTie or Cufflinks. User has an option to choose Ballgown to run on the gene or transcript level by selecting  “gene” or “transcripts” in the DataType parameter. By default, this App runs on all paired conditions combinations and generate the pairwise differential expression for each condition combination.</p>

    <p>The output from this App can be used as an input to run “Create Feature Set/Filtered Expression Matrix From Differential Expression” to get the filtered differential expression genes and filtered differential expression matrix on a given threshold cut off based on adjusted p-value and fold change.</p>

    <p><b>Note: Ballgown requires at least one intron to function. Therefore, this App will only work on eukaryotes. </b></p>

    <p><strong>Team members who developed & deployed algorithm in KBase:</strong> Srividya Ramakrishnan, Sunita Kumari, Shinjae Yoo, Priya Ranjan, Jim Thomason, Vivek Kumar, Arfath Pasha. For questions, please <a href="http://kbase.us/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p>
